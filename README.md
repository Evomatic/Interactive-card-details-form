## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [MUI 5 React component library](https://mui.com/) - design system

### What I learned

Note: This project is still a work in progress. 

### planning: 
Planning a project is probably one of the most important steps. I often found myself wanting to dive right into coding before having any real idea of what I wanted to accomplish. But holding myself back coming up with an approach to build this project was key. Was it perfect planning? Definitely not, but some planning is better than none!

### priorities:

This kind of ties in with planning, but prioritising what or how to code first was difficult. Since I went with a mobile first approach for the design, I decided to do all the styling before the functionality. Which caught me off guard at times since I often had to refactor CSS when I got to the JavaScript part. It may be better to work on the layout and functionality of the app first, then finish off with styling.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources
